Connections are GraphQL fields that take a set of arguments to specify which "slice" of the list to query, and include in their response both the "slice" of the list that was requested, as well as information to indicate if there is more data available in the list and how to query it; this additional information can be used in order to perform pagination by querying for more "slices" or pages on the list.'),Object(i.b)("p",null,"More specifically, we perform ",Object(i.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"cursor-based pagination,"),' in which the input used to query for "slices" of the list is a ',Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"cursor")," and a ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"count"),".
